Letto dal [blog di gianluca](http://aiellogianluca.wordpress.com/2006/05/23/sette-regole-per-motivarsi/) riportato da [http://www.motivation-tools.com/elements/seven\_rules.htm](http://www.motivation-tools.com/elements/seven_rules.htm)

> 1. Set a major goal, but follow a path. The path has mini goals that go in many directions. When you learn to succeed at mini goals, you will be motivated to challenge grand goals.

>
> 2. Finish what you start. A half finished project is of no use to anyone. Quitting is a habit. Develop the habit of finishing self-motivated projects.
>
> 3. Socialize with others of similar interest. Mutual support is motivating. We will develop the attitudes of our five best friends. If they are losers, we will be a loser. If they are winners, we will be a winner. To be a cowboy we must associate with cowboys.
>
> 4. Learn how to learn. Dependency on others for knowledge is a slow, time consuming processes. Man has the ability to learn without instructors. In fact, when we learn the art of self-education we will find, if not create, opportunity to find success beyond our wildest dreams.
>
> 5. Harmonize natural talent with interest that motivates. Natural talent creates motivation, motivation creates persistence and persistence gets the job done.
>
> 6. Increase knowledge of subjects that inspires. The more we know about a subject, the more we want to learn about it. A self-propelled upward spiral develops.
>
> 7. Take risk. Failure and bouncing back are elements of motivation. Failure is a learning tool. No one has ever succeeded at anything worthwhile without a string of failures.

Applicandole a me stesso ....il mio problema attualmente Ã¨ la #2: nonostante il corso di Time Management di Vigno non ho abbastanza tempo per finire quello che pianifico nell' #1 :) ...ma anche nella #7 sono un po' carente :)

e voi?
