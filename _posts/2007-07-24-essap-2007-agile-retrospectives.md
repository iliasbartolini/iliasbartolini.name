I attended at [ESSAP](http://essap.dicom.uninsubria.it/) (European Summer School on Agile Programming) a few weeks ago in Varese.  
This is my mind map of one of the most interesting courses: "[Retrospective Techniques](http://www.slideshare.net/lucagrulla/retrospectives-techniques/)" taken by [Luca Grulla](http://www.lucagrulla.it/)

...I hope to have enough time to publish some other maps soon I recently started to use [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page): another great Open Source tool!
