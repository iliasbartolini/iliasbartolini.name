Some weeks ago a close friend gifted me with a new MUG.

Since few year ago I started randomly collecting mugs and I ended up having quite a lot of them.

While putting this last mug on the shelf I noticed that there's a mug for many periods of my life and the they describe my passions and my values.

Some of them have a long story behind, some of them represent a friend, a travel or a special situation, and some of them are simply mugs :) 

Here is a short gallery of my favorite ones:
