I just finished to fill a couple of new Mind Maps...
<!--more-->

The first one is about the book "Technical Leadership" from G.M. Weinberg [/assets/content/mindmaps/TechnicalLeadership.mm](/assets/content/mindmaps/TechnicalLeadership.mm)  
...a good book, but not very good. I prefer by far the first book by Weinberg.

Some months ago I discovered the "engEdu" tag on google video... it's an excellent on-line resource about technical and computer science seminars held at Google...  
[http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Google+engEDU](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Google+engEDU)  
...take a look at a couple of seminars, you can download them and also create a personal RSS feed based on your search on google video.

Here is another example Mind Map that I created after watching the "InBox Zero" video:
