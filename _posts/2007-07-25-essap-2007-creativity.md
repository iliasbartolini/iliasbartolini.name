I'm still working on organizing my ideas from ESSAP.  
The fourth day in Varese we had a presentation about "Software Creativity"... I remember that I was very curious about it. In the end I really enjoyed Fabrizio Milo's presentation: very funny and entertaining!!

So here is another mind map about Creativity...
